# Optimizing-Drug-Delivery-in-Biomedical-Engineering
This project consist of using optimization method to tacles the problem of Drug delivery. The objective of optimizing drug delivery systems is to maximize drug concentration at the target site while minimizing side effects. This can be achieved by carefully selecting the drug dosage, delivery method, release profile, and targeted site
